# DJSets-for-Web
## Description
This Project is a small DJ-Tool for organizing Songs and Setlists. It is based on the Desktop-Project, which you can find [here](https://github.com/ericmuench/DJ-Sets), but rewritten with the Vue-Framework.
## Features
This Project is very similar to the original DJSets-Project based on WPF for Desktop. Therefore it contains very common features like:
- Manage Songs (CRUD)
- Manage Setlists (CRUD)
- Moving Songs in Setlists
- Filter for Songs
- Automatic Calculation of Setlists-Lengths based on their Songs
- Export Setlists as `txt`-File

Compared to to the original WPF-Version, this Version has the following feature differences
| Feature       | Desktop-Version   | Web-Version|
